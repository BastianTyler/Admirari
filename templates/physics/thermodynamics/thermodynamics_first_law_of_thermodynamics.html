      <h1>First Law of Thermodynamics</h1>
      <p>
        The first law of thermodynamics states in so few words that the total
        energy of a closed system remains constant.

            There is a lot surrounding the first law that we should discuss
            prior to getting to the equation. When we are doing problems
            involving thermodynamics we are attempting to model some thing in
            the real world to our mathamatical models. In the case of gases,
            trying to completly understand the movement of \(10^{23}\) gas
            particles is unreasonable. Instead we try to look at averages. In
            more scientific speech: we focus on a macrosscopic description of
            the microscopic particles.

            <p>Lets define some terms before moving on.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>System: </strong> A quantity of matter around which we
                can draw a boundary the matter will not cross. This implies a
                closed system, where the number of molecules in the system is
                constant.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Thermodynamic State & State Variables: </strong
                >Measurable variables and properties that can be used to
                determine other variables and properties. P,V, and T (Pressure,
                Volume, and Temperature) are examples. An <Strong>extensive</Strong> property
                depends on the total amount of a substance while and <strong>intensive</strong>
                properties do not depend on the total amount of the substance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Equations of State: </strong> Connects state variables
                together.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Thermodynamic Equilibrium: </strong>The state of the
                system is unchanging. This means that when the heal values, the Q values, are added 
                their sum should equal zero. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Thermodynamic Processes: </strong>Changes the state of a
                system. We will analyze processes changing at an infintesimal
                rate. This means while the gases are changing they are
                essentially stuck in equallibrium. We can call this
                quasi-equallibrium.

            First we should discuss the work involved with the gas. When the
            volume of the system the gas is inside expands then the gas will
            have done positive work, but if the gas is compressed it will have
            done negative work. This is stated as work done
            <strong>by</strong> gas on the piston. $$W_{\text{by gas on piston}}
            = \int_{i}^{f}P dV$$
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>P</strong> Pressure of the gas</li>
            <li><strong>dV</strong> differential volume changes</li>
            <li>
              <strong>\(W_{by-gas-on-piston}\)</strong> \(>0\) as it
              expands, \(W_{by-gas-on-pistion} < 0\) as it contracts. \(W_{\text{by gas on piston}} =
              -W_{\text{on gas by piston}}\)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            <p>
              The First Law of Thermodynamic is <p>$$\Delta E_{\text{internal of gas}} = Q_{\text{added to gas}} + W_{\text{on gas}}$$</p>
              Or simply
              <p>$$\Delta E_{\text{int}} = Q_{\text{in}} + W_{\text{on}}$$</p>

              From this we can gather that as you do work or add heat to a gas its internal energy will increase. Often we care about 
              the power output of an engine. For these problems use: <p>$$\Delta E_{\text{int}} = Q_{\text{in}} - W_{\text{by}}$$</p>
