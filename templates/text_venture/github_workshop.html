        <h1>Getting up and running with Git, Github, and Github Desktop</h1>
        <p>This page will help us learn how to get started with git. First we will cover what VCS, Version-Constrol-Software, is.
          Then we will visit the Git website to download and install git for our operating sytem. 
          Next we will visit Github and make an account. We will talk about the interface and then cover a few basic terms and resources.
          After that we will download github desktop for a visual solution to working with Github.
          Once that is finished it is time to get hands on with trying out the power of VCS. 
          We will only cover some basic operations, such as creating a repo, cloneing a repo, pushing changes to local main 
          and to your digital main. Editing a text file and restoring it's history to a previous commit. Creating a branch, working with
          it, and then merging it back into the project after a pull request.
