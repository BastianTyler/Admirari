        <p class="header-description">This page introduces Git and Version Control Software (VCS).
           We'll start with the basics of VCS, then install Git and set up a GitHub account. 
           After exploring the interface and key terms, we'll install GitHub Desktop for a visual 
           workflow. Finally, we'll practice core Git operations like creating and cloning repositories, 
           making commits, pushing changes, branching, and merging with pull requests.

          <h4>Glossary:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Version Control Software (VCS)</strong> - Helps track and manage changes to files over time. 
              It allows multiple users to collaborate, revert to previous versions, and maintain a history of 
              modifications, ensuring stability and efficiency in software development.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Git</strong> - Git is a free VCS that tracks project history and enables team collaboration. 
              While commonly used via the command line, this tutorial focuses on GitHub Desktop, a user-friendly GUI 
              for easier version control. If you are interested in Git, you can find its documentation 
              <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>GitHub</strong> - GitHub is a cloud based hosting service for Git projects, 
              colloquially called repositories or repos for short. It allows developers to store, manage, and track 
              changes to code while enabling team collaboration through features like repositories, branches, pull 
              requests, and issues. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>GitHub Desktop</strong> - GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that 
              simplifies using Git and GitHub. It provides an intuitive way to manage repositories, commit changes, 
              create branches, and sync code without using the command line. Ideal for beginners, it lowers the 
              barrier to entry for version control while maintaining powerful Git functionality.</li>
            <strong>Note:</strong> <i>GitHub Desktop is only available for Apple and Windows devices.</i>

          <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            Git, a free and widely used VCS, efficiently manages project history and teamwork. GitHub, a cloud-based 
            platform for hosting Git repositories, enhances collaboration with features like branches, pull requests, 
            and issues. For an easier experience, GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly GUI that simplifies Git 
            operations without requiring command-line knowledge.

        <h2 class="section-title">Making Your First Repository</h2>

        <p>
          The first step to starting any project is to create a repository, or repo for short. 
          While there are a number of ways to accomplish this, we will be creating our repository through GitHub Desktop.
          For this example, feel free to use any name you would like for your repository.
        </p>

        <!-- Code Explanation -->

          <h4>Going step by step...</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In GitHub Desktop, navigate to the File section of the menu bar, shown below. Select "New repository...",
              or simply press Ctrl+N.
            </li>

            <br>
            <li>
              Typically when making a repo, we can give it any name we want. For this example, I'll name it 
              "admirari-github-workshop".
            </li>
            <br>

              Make sure to check the box seen above under the 'Local Path' section that says "Initialize this 
              repository with a README."
              <br><br>
              <strong>What is a README?</strong> - A README is a plain text Markdown file that is used to provide essential
              information about a project. It is commonly found in software repositories, containing information about a 
              project. It's used to inform users and developers of the purpose of a project and how to interact with it.
              <br>
              We will discuss what exactly Markdown is a bit further down.
              <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>Click "Create Repository". GitHub desktop should now show you this screen:</li>

            <br>
            <li>
              Publish the repository to GitHub by pressing the "Publish repository" button located in the
              main section of GitHub Desktop as seen in the above image. Alternatively you can publish by pressing
              Ctrl+P.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              You should now see this window. Go ahead and click the blue "Publish Repository" button.

          If you followed the instructions correctly, you should now have published your repository on GitHub.
          If you want to view the files you created, or view the repository on GitHub itself, GitHub Desktop has buttons
          for these actions shown here:

        <p>
          In this section we will be making and publishing changes to the README file in the repo we just created above.
        </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Open the Repository</strong> - In order to make changes to files in our repository, we will 
              need to open it with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, i.e. Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm) 
              or text editor. If you do not have a general IDE, Visual Studio Code is recommended for its ease of use.
              It is also the IDE that will be used in this tutorial.

              Here is a link to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> for you to
              download the IDE if you do not have one already. Further guides for TextVenture will be using Intellij
              <br><br>
              <strong>Note:</strong> You may have noticed in some screenshots that I am actually using an IDE called VSCodium. 
              This IDE is a freely-licensed binary distribution of Visual Studio Code. It works exactly the same, but 
              is open source. If you are interested, you can find more information at the 
              <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank">VSCodium website</a>.
              <br><br>
              Once you have your editor of choice, you should notice that GitHub Desktop gives you the option to open your
              repository in your code editor. 
              <br><br>

              <img
                src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gitHub-workshop-images/open-repo-in.png') }}"
                class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"
                style="max-width: 400px"
                alt="GitHub Desktop open in editor button."
              />

              <br>
              If your editor of choice is not named by the button shown, navigate to:
              <br>
              <strong>File > Options > Integrations > External Editor</strong>
              <br>
              From there, use the drop down list to select your editor of choice.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
              <strong>Editing Our README</strong> - Once we have our repository open in our code editor, we can start
              making changes to our README. Go ahead and click on README.md in the explorer menu.
              <br><br>

              <img
                src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gitHub-workshop-images/open-readme.png') }}"
                class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"

                alt="VSC with no tab open, arrow pointing to repository README."
              />

              <br>
              <strong>I don't see a README in my repo!</strong>
              <br>
              You may have forgotten to create a README when creating your repo in a previous step. That's ok! You can
              simply right click in the explorer menu of VSCode and select "New File." Make sure to name it "README.md".

                  <strong>What is Markdown?</strong>
                  <br>
                  Markdown is a markup language used for formatting text. It allows you to add heading, <strong>bold</strong>
                  and <i>italic</i> text, list, links, and more - without the need for HTML or styling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Basic Markdown Syntax Examples</strong>
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bold</strong> → <code>**bold text**</code></li>
                    <li><i>Italic</i> → <code>*italic text*</code></li>
                    <li>Lists:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>- Item 1</code></li>
                      <li><code>- Item 2</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Code block:</li>

                </li>
              </ul>

              As an example, I have included a screenshot of the README that displays on 
              <a href="https://github.com/newproph" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a> as it appears in my IDE.
              <br>

        <p>
          Now that we have made changes to our project, lets commit these changes to our published project on GitHub.
          Doing this is a relatively simple process through GitHub Desktop. All you need to do is fill out the
          information in this section in the bottom right. Since the automatically generated field is 
          descriptive enough, I'm just going to go ahead and press "Commit to main". This will push the changes
          we made to the README to the project as it is hosted on GitHub itself.
          <br>
          <strong>Be careful doing this in larger projects!</strong> 
          <br>
          You may want to create new branch of the repository for any minor changes.
          We will discuss branches below.

      <div class="practice-section">
        <h3>What if someone else made changes to the project?</h3>
        <p>
          In order to make sure you have the most recent version of code for a project, make sure to regularly
          fetch updates from the repository. You can do this in GitHub Desktop by clicking the following button:
        </p>
        
        <img
          src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gitHub-workshop-images/fetch-origin.png') }}"

          style="max-width: 600px"
          alt="Fetch origin button."
        />
        <br>
        <p>
          <strong>It is good practice to fetch the latest updates to a repository before committing changes!</strong>

          Let's create a new class in the `src` folder; I'll call it `MyClass`. Let's use the 
            standard `psvm` to create our program's entry point, and then let's use `sout` for a basic print line. You might have an error here.
            If so, go to your project structure and reselect or change your Java SDK. If the errors are gone, great! Let's 
            make a commit and push that to our online repo.

          Now we are going to make a new branch. This will let us have isolated development
          environments to create a single feature or work on bugs. Navigate to the branch button at the top of GitHub Desktop 
          as shown (img here). I'll call my branch `feature-one` and create it. Notice the working branch changed from `main`!
          Let's go to our project in IntelliJ and add a for loop. Mine will run three times and print out
          each number. I'll run it once to see if it works, then go back to GitHub Desktop. I'll commit these
          changes to the `feature-one` branch. If I am happy with my changes, I can now try and merge it with 
          my `main` branch. There are several options for this. We could do a merge and commit by selecting "Merge into main" and then "Commit" (img here),
          or we could propose a pull request. Let's practice both.
