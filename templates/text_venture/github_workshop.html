           We'll start with the basics of VCS, then install Git and set up a GitHub account. 
           After exploring the interface and key terms, we'll install GitHub Desktop for a visual 
           workflow. Finally, we'll practice core Git operations like creating and cloning repositories, 
           making commits, pushing changes, branching, and merging with pull requests.

          <h4>Glossary:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Version Control Software (VCS)</strong> - Helps track and manage changes to files over time. 
              It allows multiple users to collaborate, revert to previous versions, and maintain a history of 
              modifications, ensuring stability and efficiency in software development.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Git</strong> - Git is a free VCS that tracks project history and enables team collaboration. 
              While commonly used via the command line, this tutorial focuses on GitHub Desktop, a user-friendly GUI 
              for easier version control. If you are interested in Git, you can find its documentation 
              <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>GitHub</strong> - GitHub is a cloud based hosting service for Git projects, 
              colloquially called repositories or repos for short. It allows developers to store, manage, and track 
              changes to code while enabling team collaboration through features like repositories, branches, pull 
              requests, and issues. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>GitHub Desktop</strong> - GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that 
              simplifies using Git and GitHub. It provides an intuitive way to manage repositories, commit changes, 
              create branches, and sync code without using the command line. Ideal for beginners, it lowers the 
              barrier to entry for version control while maintaining powerful Git functionality.</li>
            <strong>Note:</strong> <i>GitHub Desktop is only available for Apple and Windows devices.</i>

          <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            Git, a free and widely used VCS, efficiently manages project history and teamwork. GitHub, a cloud-based 
            platform for hosting Git repositories, enhances collaboration with features like branches, pull requests, 
            and issues. For an easier experience, GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly GUI that simplifies Git 
            operations without requiring command-line knowledge.

        <h2 class="section-title">Making Your First Repository</h2>

        <p>The first step to starting any project is to create a repository, or repo for short. 
          While there are a number of ways to accomplish this, we will be creating our repository through GitHub Desktop.
          We're going to start by making a page to display when users visit your GitHub profile.</p>

        <!-- Code Explanation -->
        <div class="code-explanation">
          <h4>Going step by step...</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>In GitHub Desktop, navigate to the File section of the menu bar, shown below. Select "New repository...",
              or simply press Ctrl+N.
            </li>
            <br>
            
            <img

              class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"
              style="max-width: 350px;"
              alt="GitHub Desktop menu bar with New repository option selected."
            />
            
            <br>
            <li>Typically when making a repo, we can give it any name we want. For the purposes of making a page that
              displays on your profile, create a repo with the same name as your GitHub username.
            </li>
            <br>

            <img
              src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gitHub-workshop-images/New-Repo-Name.png') }}"

              alt="Window prompting the user for information relating to the creation of a new repository."
            />

            <br>
            <li>
              Make sure to check the box seen above under the 'Local Path' section that says "Initialize this 
              repository with a README."
              <br><br>
              <strong>What is a README?</strong> - A README is a plain text Markdown file that is used to provide essential
              information about a project. It is commonly found in software repositories, containing information about a 
              project. It's used to inform users and developers of the purpose of a project and how to interact with it.
              <br>
              We will discuss what exactly Markdown is a bit further down.
              <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>Click "Create Repository". GitHub desktop should now show you this screen:</li>
            <br>

            <img

            />

            <br>
            <li>
              Publish the repository to GitHub by pressing the "Publish repository" button located in the
              main section of GitHub Desktop as seen in the above image. Alternatively you can publish by pressing
              Ctrl+P.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              You should now see this window. Make sure to uncheck the box that says "Keep this code private"
              before publishing your repository.
            </li>
            <br>

            <img
              src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gitHub-workshop-images/publish-repo-window.png') }}"

          If you followed the instructions correctly, you should now have published your repository on GitHub.
          If you want to view the files you created, or view the repository on GitHub itself, GitHub Desktop has buttons
          for these actions shown here:

        <p>
          In this section we will be creating a README file that will show up on our GitHub profile.
        </p>

        <!-- Code Explanation -->
        <div class="code-explanation">
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Open the Repository</strong> - In order to make changes to files in our repository, we will 
              need to open it with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, i.e. Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm) 
              or text editor. If you do not have a general IDE, Visual Studio Code is recommended for its ease of use.
              It is also the IDE that will be used in this tutorial.

              Here is a link to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> for you to
              download the IDE if you do not have one already.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Note:</strong> You may have noticed in some screenshots that I am actually using an IDE called VSCodium. 
              This IDE is a freely-licensed binary distribution of Visual Studio Code. It works exactly the same, but 
              is open source. If you are interested, you can find more information at the 
              <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank">VSCodium website</a>.
              <br><br>
              Once you have your editor of choice, you should notice that GitHub Desktop gives you the option to open your
              repository in your code editor. 
              <br><br>

              <img
                src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gitHub-workshop-images/open-repo-in.png') }}"
                class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"
                style="max-width: 400px"
                alt="GitHub Desktop open in editor button."
              />

              <br>
              If your editor of choice is not named by the button shown, navigate to:
              <br>
              <strong>File > Options > Integrations > External Editor</strong>
              <br>
              From there, use the drop down list to select your editor of choice.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
              <strong>Editing Our README</strong> - Once we have our repository open in our code editor, we can start
              making changes to our README. Go ahead and click on README.md in the explorer menu.
              <br><br>

              <img
                src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/gitHub-workshop-images/open-readme.png') }}"
                class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"
                style="max-width: 400px"
                alt="VSC with no tab open, arrow pointing to repository README."
              />

              <br>
              <strong>I don't see a README in my repo!</strong>
              <br>
              You may have forgotten to create a README when creating your repo in a previous step. That's ok! You can
              simply right click in the explorer menu of VSCode and select "New File." Make sure to name it "README.md".

              <strong>Time to Make Introductions</strong> - Now it's time to talk about Markdown.

                  <strong>What is Markdown?</strong>
                  <br>
                  Markdown is a markup language used for formatting text. It allows you to add heading, <strong>bold</strong>
                  and <i>italic</i> text, list, links, and more - without the need for HTML or styling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Basic Markdown Syntax Examples</strong>
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bold</strong> → <code>**bold text**</code></li>
                    <li><i>Italic</i> → <code>*italic text*</code></li>
                    <li>Lists:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>- Item 1</code></li>
                      <li><code>- Item 2</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Code block:</li>
                    <code>```<br>print("Hello, Markdown!")<br>```</code>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              Now you can create your own introductory page. This section is open ended, so feel free to take your
              time and create something that feels right for you. As an example, here is a screenshot of 
              <a href="https://github.com/newproph" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a> as it appears in my IDE.

          Let's make another one! So I'll call the new text file Song-Two.txt. I'll commit this in the same
          manner. Let's say I wasn't happy with Song-One. Let's go to the History. Notice we can see the things we 
          did in the past here. Let's right-click on the first commit. Select "Revert this commit" (img here). If it worked, then you should notice
          that the first file vanished! We just went back to a save point in our project. This can be a powerful and frustrating 
          feature. Misuse can lead to merge conflicts, something we will not go into much detail about in this tutorial.
          Be careful using this feature.

          Let's make a new file here now. Select the "New file" button as shown (img here).
            I'm going to make a TXT file called Fav-Song.txt. I'll save this to my repo, and done. Now,
            let's go back to GitHub Desktop. We have two options now: we could fetch from the main branch, or we could pull
            from the main branch. When fetching, know that we are making a new commit of our project from the online repo. Pulling 
            will not create a new commit. There are several ways to do this. You can click "Fetch origin" or "Pull origin" (img here) or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
            After we did our pull, notice we have the file we added to the project via the online repo!

          Let's open up IntelliJ. Now select "New Project" (img here) and make a new project. 
          We are not going to initialize it with Git or version control. Give it a name and, if needed,
          select Java for the type of project. Make sure to create it inside of your repo. To get the path to your
          repo, go to GitHub Desktop, right-click your repo, and find it in Explorer. Select the link in the search 
          bar at the top of the Explorer menu and copy the link. Create your project. Notice in GitHub Desktop there 
          are a bunch of changes. If not, there is a problem! Redo steps again. Look at it as a chance to memorize it.

          Let's create a new class in the `src` folder; I'll call it `MyClass`. Let's use the 
            standard `psvm` to create our program's entry point, and then let's use `sout` for a basic print line. You might have an error here.
            If so, go to your project structure and reselect or change your Java SDK. If the errors are gone, great! Let's 
            make a commit and push that to our online repo.

        <p>
          Now we are going to make a new branch. This will let us have isolated development
          environments to create a single feature or work on bugs. Navigate to the branch button at the top of GitHub Desktop 
          as shown (img here). I'll call my branch `feature-one` and create it. Notice the working branch changed from `main`!
          Let's go to our project in IntelliJ and add a for loop. Mine will run three times and print out
          each number. I'll run it once to see if it works, then go back to GitHub Desktop. I'll commit these
          changes to the `feature-one` branch. If I am happy with my changes, I can now try and merge it with 
          my `main` branch. There are several options for this. We could do a merge and commit by selecting "Merge into main" and then "Commit" (img here),
          or we could propose a pull request. Let's practice both.
